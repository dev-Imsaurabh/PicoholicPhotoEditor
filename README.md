## About
This is my second app published on playstore and this was the biggest project at that time for me. When i was in the mid of Android App Development journey i developed this app in one week. The journey was quite struggling with so much of research on web. I wanted to create this app from scratch without using any library . So , I reasearched so much but i dont even got a single youtube video to create a full photo editor app from scratch. Also i have searched on platform like Udemy but i got nothing. Now , I have only one option that is stackoverflow and github. I started searching on google and there also i dont even find a single whole project which tells me to how to start from scratch.

Now , I break the steps of development and started searching for initial need for the app like:-

Level 1- Save the static images ,text and layout background in gallery.<br>
Level 2- Save the dynamic images ,text and layout background in gallery.<br>
Level 3- implementation of drag and move images and text over background image of the layout.<br>
Level 4- Implementation of image cropper for image.<br>
Level 5- Implementation of Text element and image element over image and perform action like resize.<br>
Level 6- Predefined frames for imageView.<br>
Level 7- Applying features of Filters.<br>
Level 8- Applying features of Borders and Backgrounds.<br>
Level 9- Saving Layout and Sharing the image from App.<br>
Level 10- Set Whatsapp DP through passing image URI through Intent.<br>

Final Level- I merged all the levels with beautiful UI.

Bingo ðŸ¤ž.. its done :)

What i have learnt in this journey - You cant find whole project from scratch but you can break the whole project into steps and you will get all the answers on Google.
